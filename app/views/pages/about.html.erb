     <h2>About Rowing Diary</h2>
     <p>Rowing Diary is the easiest and simplest way to manage all your rowing training data. It's been built by rowers for rowers.</p>
     <p>Our approach to building rowing diary was that as elite athletes we had everything stored in books. However with smartphones this changed everything. We wanted something more to help us analyse our own performance. So we built rowing diary to help ourselves and now for the rest of the rowing community.</p>
     <p>Why choose rowing diary? Over the years many coaches have been using google docs as their method to track our performance. For us this didn't work. We wanted something more for ourselves, a tool that allowed us to track and analyse our own progress and performance.</p>
     <p>We've built Rowing Diary to track elements of training we felt are truley important to elite athletes.</p>

	 
	 <p>1. Ergo sessions</p>
	 <p>2. Weights session</p>
	 <p>3. Water sessions - (coming soon)</p>
	 <p>4. Morning monitoring- (coming soon)</p>

	<p>These four areas will give you enough feedback on your performance to help you make the most put of the next session.</p>
